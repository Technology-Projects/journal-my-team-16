# CASE-3 — Smart Home Device Incident & Data Access

## Context

HomeSphere, a smart‑home manufacturer, sells voice‑activated devices that process audio locally and only upload recordings to the cloud when a wake word is detected. 

Following a burglary in a customer’s home, police requested 48 hours of audio logs from HomeSphere, arguing the device may have captured relevant background noise or conversations before the break‑in.

HomeSphere’s terms of service state that audio logs are stored encrypted and can be accessed only for “service improvement and troubleshooting.” The device owner is unsure whether they want to grant police access because the logs contain sensitive family conversations unrelated to the incident.

## The issue

The police submitted a legal request that appears valid, but HomeSphere engineers warn that providing raw logs might set a precedent for future investigative requests. 

The privacy team argues that releasing more data than strictly necessary could undermine customer trust and contradict the company’s claim that it handles only minimal personal data.

## Decision point

The company must choose whether to provide the full logs, only narrowly relevant snippets, or refuse and challenge the request. It must weigh compliance with law enforcement, user privacy expectations, operational capability, and the long‑term social implications of normalising access to domestic conversation data.
